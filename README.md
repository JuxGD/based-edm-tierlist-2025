# Based EDM tierlist 2025
This repository contains an **objectively correct** and **based** tierlist of ALL 2025 electronic music that I know, including unofficial releases. The tracks in each tier are in order of addition, not of quality. It's done by track, not by release, i.e. an LP, EP or A/B will have its individual songs rated, rather than the release as a whole.

## Contributing
To contribute, open an issue suggesting one or several tracks. Try to make sure your suggestions aren't already on the list. I'll then listen to them and rank them, closing the issue with the ranking. Don't do pull requests!
