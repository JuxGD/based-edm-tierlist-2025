# Based EDM tierlist 2025

This repository contains an **objectively correct** and **based** tierlist of ALL 2025 electronic music that I know, including unofficial releases. The tracks in each tier are in order of addition, not of quality. It's done by track, not by release, i.e. an LP, EP or A/B will have its individual songs rated separately, rather than the release as a whole.

## Format

Tiers are separated by files. Listed tracks are in this format:

```md
<!-- a-tier.md -->

### A-tier

- <artist(s)> - <title> | <release> on <label>
- <artist(s)2> - <title2> | <release2> on <label2>
```

Where the track by <artist(s)> is considered better than the track by <artist(s)2> within the A tier. The higher up a track is in the list, the better it's considered to be.

## Contributing

To contribute, open an issue suggesting one or several tracks. Try to make sure your suggestions aren't already on the list. I'll then listen to them and rank them, closing the issue with the ranking. Reserve pull requests for typos, format improvements, or if a previously unreleased track is released under a label. If you want to improve the format, keep in mind that the "higher up the better" thing and the tier order must not change.
